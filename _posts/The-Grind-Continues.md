Geez, I remember when I said I would try to post every week... so much for that. Almost a month now at my first Software Engineering internship & I have learned so much valuable information. I definitely have a new favorite framework ( Vue ). While I still use Next.js for my personal website & maybe sometimes play around with React, Vue will probably be my go to now along with Tailwind CSS. I just recently finished a building a LinkTree clone using Vue, Tailwind, Nest.js & MongoDB. I found Nest.js really fun to learn as it is so different from the way I usually do things. They have really good documentation on how to get set up & I was able to convert my half built backend to a full one in about a day using thier framework. I'll also be looking to dive deeper into Nest.js and build future projects with it. MongoDB was new to me as well but it wasn't that bad as there is tons of helpful resources out there. I have a few new project ideas in mind but it is tough with my current schedule + life. I think I will be taking more time to touch up on my javascript fundamentals & learn more about backend. I am also in the process of looking for a internship/full-time position for the fall, so any time that I am not spending writing code, I am filling out applications. I'll occasionally try to make some changes for this site but I will get to that when I have time. I've been in the process of converting the styling for this site from scss to tailwind and I immediately regretted it. Well that's about it folks, till next time.
