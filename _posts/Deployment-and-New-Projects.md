About 2 weeks since my last post & wow does time fly when you are busy 24/7. I always tend to lose track of time when I am diving deep into a project. I am happy to say it all paid off as forumly is up and running and seems to be bug free (for now...). I tend to be a perfectionist when it comes to my work and I hate leaving things unfinished or sloppy. This is what set me back with forumly, as I would get close to finally being done, I would spot something else that I know would bother me until I fixed it. Now that's not to say that the site is perfect & I am done with it. There are many features I want to add, both technical and visual, that I will get to when time permits. Having spent so much time on forumly, I haven't had much time to work on any other projects.

Applications for Shopify internships opened up last week and it seemed like a great opportunity to build something new and maybe land a position for the summer. The task given was really interesting and has been a blast to work with so far. I am using React, Next.js, Material UI, Scss, Swiper & Redux for this project. Material UI has been my go to library for all my projects and I can see why it is so popular. I find myself being able to build out pages so much faster and efficient, giving me more time to focus on functionality. I am new to Redux so it has been fun to start learning it and have been able to implement it in my project fairly easy. Upon completion, I will add my project info and repo to my website. It will be deployed but won't stay up for long due to API token limits. Additionally, I plan on writing a post on how I was able to use Next.js API routes and OpenAI to smoothly build out my application.
